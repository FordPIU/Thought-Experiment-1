# Thought Experiment 1

## Description
You have groups of 30 people, containing 15 male, 15 female, and each are assigned random traits.

Every cycle/tick each person ranks every other person, and the person ranked lowest in each group is eliminated, while the highest 2 in each group produces offspring.

*Got the idea from a South Park episode.*
